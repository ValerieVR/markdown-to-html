                <h2>Me, in one sentence</h2>
                <p>
                    In one sentence, I'd describe myself as indescribable.
                    But, I wouldn't end it with a period. 
                    I'd end it with three dots - <i>Jason Schwartzman</i>

                <h2>A funny story</h2>
                <p>
                    When I was a kid the ball I was playing with fell on a car and the car's alarm went off.<br/>
                    I panicked and ran back into my house.<br/>
                    I wouldn't leave my house for the rest of the day because I was scared that the police would come and arrest me.<br/>
                    The next day I kept looking out the window to see if the police would show up.
